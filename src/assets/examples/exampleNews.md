        I come home in the morning light<br>
        My mother says, <mark>“When you gonna live your life right?”</mark><br>
        Oh mother dear we’re not the fortunate ones<br>
        And devs, they wanna have fun<br>
        Oh devs just want to have fun</p>
      <p style="text-align:center">
        The phone rings in the middle of the night<br>
        My father yells, "What you gonna do with your life?"<br>
        Oh daddy dear, you know you’re still number one<br>
        But <s>girls</s>devs, they wanna have fun<br>
        Oh devs just want to have
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:center">
        That’s all they really want<br>
        Some fun<br>
        When the working day is done<br>
        Oh devs, they wanna have fun<br>
        Oh devs just wanna have fun<br>
        (devs, they wanna, wanna have fun, devs wanna have)
      </p>
